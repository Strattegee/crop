# Run log

Newest first. One entry per working session or scheduled run.

## 2026-10-25 night (scheduled run)

- Shipped: eligibility when assigning (backlog item 3). The roster now refuses to put someone on a shift if they don't have the role, a required credential or right to work won't be current on the shift date, they're already rostered then, or it would take a visa holder over their fortnightly hours. It warns about short rest between shifts (10 hours by default, changeable) and credentials expiring soon. New "who can work this shift" list, ready people first.
- Skipped item 2 (roster screen) for now: the working-alone rules hold Ribbon roster design for Steve's review, so it waits for David to confirm.
- Next: equipment on the roster (item 4) unless David clears the roster screen.

## 2026-10-25 evening (with David)

- Shipped: employer roster foundations — employment terms (full-time, part-time, casual, bank; contracted hours), shift codes, shifts (single or blocks across weekdays, overnight shifts, site time zones), assigning people with double-booking blocked, confirm, unassign, cancel, and a roster endpoint with hours per person. Website rewritten to lead with employers.
- Next: roster screen (backlog item 2).

## 2026-10-25 afternoon (with David, after meeting Steve)

- Changed direction: CROP is first an employer roster; agencies fill shifts through an allocation screen when employers press Agency fill. Backlog reordered; decisions and open questions in `docs/decisions/2026-10-25-roster-meeting.md`.
- Next: employer roster foundations (backlog item 1).

## 2026-10-25 (with David)

- Shipped: document preview on hover; add-credential form shows the right fields per type; clearer Messages test buttons; expiry reminders (CRD-7); notification service and Messages page.
- Decided: CROP is multi-industry (packs: healthcare, labour hire, construction, hospitality); CFY's first release centres on shift filling, not the Ribbon roster; scheduled runs work alone with the approval rules in `docs/WORKING-ALONE.md`.
- Next: shifts and shift requests (backlog item 1).
- Waiting: ClickSend number (Mon), Steve's roster review.
